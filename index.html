							Our app is designed to help you learn/remember any topic that is important to you. Whether it is remembering coworker's names, key coding concepts, or any information under the sun, we want to help you (and ourselves) transfer concepts into long-term memory. Through failure-based repetition, you can efficiently encode any info into your brain in the most impactful way possible.

						<h3 class="heading-tertiary u-margin-bottom-small">Quick, fun to use</h3>
						<p class="paragraph">
							When designing this app, we knew it was important to create a fun gameplay experience. Through fun transitions, animations, and good feedback, we create a polished user experience that all will want to utilize for their brain-training needs.

						<p class="paragraph">
							Using a variation of the Leitner system, we created a dynamic card-selection algorithm that shows a subset of the entire deck, giving the user a good chance to succeed through repetition.

						<p class="paragraph">
							So far, the decks are pre-built to show the capabilities of the game. Some are only used to show how the algorithm can teach you completely random information within seconds. User-made decks on the way!

							Keeping the user in mind, a polished display was crucial for creating a fun experience for all. Custom animations make for a unique experience that provides seamless positive and negative reinforcement.

Iâ€™ve learned that if part of the tutoring process were automated, especially the rote memorization and review, it could multiply my efforts as a personal tutor."

							<br>
							Coming out of this project, my knowledge on all things frontend has surpassed my wildest expectations. The core concepts and breakthrough moments we both learned during development will be used throughout our careers."
