Using the app during development, we were getting used to the answers. When this was becoming a factor during tests of the algorithm, The "random" deck was created. the word answer is connected to a random color, so you have to guess. After three minutes, you'll see that you are actually learning them!

Since we are making this app for ourselves as much as for the user, the css trivia deck was fun to create and quiz ourselves on, so we dont forget all the useful info!
